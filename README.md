# asanajsonprinter
Browser-based tool to convert JSON-output of Asana projects into an easy to print HTML table

## Purpose 
The purpose of this tool is to overcome the limited printing capabilities of Asana. It uses JSON export data generated by Asana and converts it into a HTML table that can be printed or copied to other software (e.g. E-Mail, Word).

## This is a hobby project
However, as this is a hobby project, don't expect too much and use it at your own risk. :-)

## How to install and use it
Just copy the how pack of files into a directory of choice. Then open the asanajsonprinter.html file in a (up-to-date) browser. 

## Technical stuff
The tool is a browser-based software using standard web techniques (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS). The tool is completely client-sided and no data exchange with Asana or other external servers or services happens. The tool is in a state where it can be used in daily work life. The tool requires an up-to-date web browser like Chrome 63, IE11, Firefox 57 because of HTML5 techniques used.
